# Hnefatafl-AI
A C# implementation of Hnefatafl. The goal is to have a functioning Bot to play against.
Currently it's a console application (maybe in the future I'll try and make something with WPF).

## Current project status:
  * Board and pieces are fully implemented
  * Pieces' position and player moves are fully implemented and fully validated
  * GameEngine processes captures (both for normal pieces and king)
  * Added Attacker's victory condition (Defender's to be implemented)
  * Moves repetition is to be fixed
  * The bot just moves randomly (it chooses randomly from a list of valid moves)
